 # Ideas
 
 ## Prefabs
 Use component data objects, with codegen functions to read/write binary data. Prefab overrides are just applied as sparse data as an addiitional read. Allow other objects to hold an override set for some other component, so that a spawner can apply overrides to each obecjt spawned.
